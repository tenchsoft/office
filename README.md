## Overview

Tench Office is a cross-platform office suite built entirely in Rust with Tauri 2. It bundles four editors that run locally — no telemetry, no accounts, no server round-trips for editing. AI assistance flows through the local Tench Engine, so your documents never leave your machine.

The suite targets Windows, macOS, and Linux. A single `$1/month` subscription per device unlocks every update across all four editors — cancel anytime, keep the version you have.

## Products

| | Product | Description | Default format |
|---|---|---|---|
| 📝 | **Docs** | Word processor with track changes, comments, templates | `.docx` |
| 📊 | **Sheets** | Spreadsheet with 200+ formulas, charts, pivot tables | `.xlsx` |
| 🎤 | **Slides** | Presentations with AI layout, presenter mode | `.pptx` |
| 🇰🇷 | **Kodocs** | Korean document editor with full HWP/HWPX fidelity | `.hwp` / `.hwpx` |

Kodocs is the suite's Korean-market differentiator — a native HWP editor that respects 한글 and 한컴 포맷 정밀하게.

## Features

- **100% Rust** — engine, UI, formats, AI plumbing. No JavaScript anywhere.
- **Local-first AI** — inference runs through Tench Engine via IPC, never HTTP.
- **Format roundtrip** — `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`, `.hwp`, `.hwpx`, Markdown, PDF, HTML, plain text.
- **Privacy by construction** — files stay on your disk; no analytics, no auto-update of "the cloud".
- **Cross-platform** — Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS from a single Rust codebase.
- **Self-built UI** — `tench-ui` is an in-house retained-mode widget framework rendered via Vello + wgpu. No Electron, no web view.
